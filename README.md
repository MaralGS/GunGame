- Now we send animations between players.

Difficulties:
Faced many challenges while implementing the gameloop, as we were unsure how to fully transmit the information.

Gameplay:
- AD: Movement
- Space: Jump
- LeftClick: Shoot
- S: Shield

Main Scene: 
- Servers

Instructions:

- At the start, it will prompt you to create a server or join one. First, create the server, and then join as the 2 players (using the local IP address of the server). Once players are connected, the server should start the game.

- If you eliminate an enemy, you will switch to a different weapon. There are 6 weapons in total, each with unique functionalities. Blocking with the shield at the right moment will prevent bullets from causing damage. The first player to eliminate opponents with all weapons wins the game.
